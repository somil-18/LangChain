India rises with the first light brushing the Himalayan stone.
Rivers carve ancient memories through fields of gold and green.
Cities pulse with energy, where old and new walk shoulder to shoulder.
Markets hum with colour, scent, and voices stitched together.
Monsoons drum on rooftops like a long-awaited song.
Deserts shimmer with heat, guarding stories the winds still whisper.
Every festival sparks a fire that pulls millions into its glow.
Every language carries a rhythm shaped by its own history.
A land that bends but never breaks, layered with quiet resilience.
India stands vast and restless, forever learning to become itself.
