The pitch wakes up as the bowler storms in with intent.
The seam kisses the air, hunting for a moment to bend.
The bat meets fate in a heartbeat that splits the ground.
Fielders tighten the circle, hungry for the slightest sound.
The crowd rises like a wave, pulled by every swing.
A six cuts through the sky, a brief, burning king.
Spikes scratch the turf as strategies shift in silence.
Every run is a battle, every wicket a quiet violence.
Time slows when the final over begins its crawl.
Victory erupts — one shot, one roar, conquers all.
